Immersive augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences in education can give a interesting technique to learn.Â 

In AR, digital information is overlaid onto the physical world, allowing students to interact with virtual objects or information in their real-world environment. For example, a student could use an AR app on their phone to view a 3D model of a cell and manipulate it in real-time, learning about its various parts and functions. AR can also be used to provide interactive experiences in field trips, such as viewing historical landmarks or artifacts in their original locations.

VR, on the other hand, completely immerses the user in a digital environment, often using a headset and handheld controllers. This can allow students to experience simulations or virtual field trips that would be otherwise impossible or impractical in real life. For example, a student could visit ancient Rome or take a virtual tour of a distant planet. VR can also be used to provide simulations for training or practice, such as in medical or military education. Overall, immersive AR and VR experiences can provide a dynamic and interactive way for students to learn and engage with educational content.
